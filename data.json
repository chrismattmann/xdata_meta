This is most often mediated by geometric entities (such as circles, squares and text) but always involves pixels eventually to display. In most systems, the pixels are tucked away under levels of abstraction in the rendering system. Abstract Rendering takes the opposite approach: expose the pixels and gain powerful pixel-level control. This pixel-level power is a complement to many existing visualization techniques. It is an elaboration on rendering, not an analytic or projection step, so it can be used as an epilogue to many existing techniques. In standard rendering, geometric objects are projected to an image and represented on that image's discrete pixels. The source space is an abstract canvas that contains logically continuous geometric primitives and the target space is an image that contains discrete colors. Abstract Rendering fits between these two states. It introduces a discretization of the data at the pixel-level, but not necessarily all the way to colors. This enables many pixel-level concerns to be efficiently and concisely captured.",

It allows users to trade-off query accuracy for response time, enabling interactive queries over massive data by running queries on data samples and presenting results annotated with meaningful error bars. To achieve this, BlinkDB uses two key ideas: (1) An adaptive optimization framework that builds and maintains a set of multi-dimensional samples from original data over time, and (2) A dynamic sample selection strategy that selects an appropriately sized sample based on a query's accuracy and/or response time requirements. We have evaluated BlinkDB on the well-known TPC-H benchmarks, a real-world analytic workload derived from Conviva Inc. and are in the process of deploying it at Facebook Inc. ",
